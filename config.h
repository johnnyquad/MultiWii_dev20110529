/* Failsave settings - added by MIS
   Failsafe check pulse on THROTTLE channel. If the pulse is OFF (on only THROTTLE or on all channels) the failsafe procedure is initiated.
   After FAILSAVE_DELAY time of pulse absence, the level mode is on (if ACC or nunchuk is avaliable), PITCH, ROLL and YAW is centered
   and THROTTLE is set to FAILSAVE_THR0TTLE value. You must set this value to descending about 1m/s or so for best results. 
   This value is depended from your configuration, AUW and some other params. 
   Next, afrer FAILSAVE_OFF_DELAY the copter is disarmed, and motors is stopped.
   If RC pulse coming back before reached FAILSAVE_OFF_DELAY time, after the small quard time the RC control is returned to normal.
   If you use serial sum PPM, the sum converter must completly turn off the PPM SUM pusles for this FailSafe functionality.*/
